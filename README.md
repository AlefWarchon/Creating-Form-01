## Creating-Forms-01
<h3 align="center">The objective</h3>

> <p align="start">
> The idea of creating this form was for further learning, reviewing and applying new concepts
> <br/>
> This form was created from zero based on figma and without consultation
> <br/>
> I tried to be as close as possible to figma
> <br/>
> It was also implemented a better accessibility by darkening what didn't have the ideal contrast when you put the mouse on top of it
> <br/>
> Only one input had minimum mandatory characters and the minlength was added then only on it.
> <br/>
> No input with mandatory requirement added to not mess up the layout too much, but you can get a sense of input:invalid with the minLenght input applied
> </p>
